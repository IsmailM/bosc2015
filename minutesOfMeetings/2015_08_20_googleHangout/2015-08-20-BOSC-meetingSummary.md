# Summary of GoogleHangout 1500-1600 CEST

## Main conclusions/decisions

- current list of features considered by everyone who commented on it, as being too long and having too much redundancy
- we discussed and agreed the following "scope" of the communities to be valid for inclusion in the document "*open source scientific communities but stressing/emphasis on biological communities  using [OSI definiton of it](opensource.org/osd-annotated), and including training communities, specifically Software and Data Carpentry*"
- a concern raised by several of us, several times, was that we should aim to not leave out any of the communities that could be included in this scope that we feel are "great"
- once we're happy with our list of features, our current plan is to 
- we'd be potentially interested in meeting again like this, if it feels useful
- we talked about wanting to make sure we include examples of great communities of this kind - while at the same time acknowledging that there's a chicken-and-egg problem here i.e. part of the aim of the paper is to describe what we mean by a community being 'great'
- to collect feedback/content describing features of great open source scientific communities, we'll choose together a set of questions we'll then send to relevant people in different communities, asking for their replies to them - we'll collect them in a file in the github repo, people can contribute by fetch/pull request or by mailing us answers

## Action points

- next step is agree amongst a small group of us, working together at the same time, probably meeting online, a set of features; once we have this, we will use these in discussion with other people to build consensus on this list; @AidanBudd will organise this, @bgruening  maybe, @aidanbudd, @konrad after next week, @gedankenstuecke , would be up for this, if they can find a good time/date
- we aim to decide a provisional time-frame to get this work finished @aidanbudd will organise this
