/><b>Plan for Hangout:</b><br
/><br
/>Introduction to the reason, and plan, for the hangout @AidanBudd<br
/><br
/>@AidanBudd describes vision for developing the project - all subject to change based on your opinions and ideas, but useful as an initial reference:<br
/><ul><li>choose a group of features of great communities of this kind</li
><li>collect from many different communities, examples of these features expressing themselves</li
><li>key benefit/feature comes from including examples from many different communities</li
><li>another key benefit comes from actively bringing people from all these different communities together to discuss these issues and collaborate together on such an article</li
><li>before going to individuals we know in specific communities to get their feedback/contributions, think it's best to have it clear (by example from content provided by communities we have experience of) the kinds of comments/content they can add, to make the barrier to contribution/entry as low as possible by keeping communication as open as possible we live the open source ethos, make it easier for others to see how we did it if they want to do so in the future, and build trust etc. - only things I want to keep off it are (obviously) illegal/libelous comments, disrespecful comments, and lists/discussions of indivdiaulas e.g. "have we contacted X yet?" - perhaps use the rule "only refer to people by name/handle if they've contributed to the repo in some way either with a commit or a comment?<br/><br
/></li></ul
>I'm going to (try) taking the role of neutral facilitator - plenty of my preferences and opinions have gone into current state of the project, I really want this to be shaped by other peoples ideas, so I'm happy to be neutral in this meeting - if I really feel the need to drop that role, I'll let you know I'm doing it.<br
/><br
/>1. Introduce ourselves in a couple of sentences, tell us if you've any time constraints<br
/><br
/>2. Want everyone to have a chance to talk about whatever they think is important, so do (maximal 20? 30? we'll use majority voting for this) Lean Coffee to give them control of discussion topics - first time I try this online, it works great in person for giving everyone influence over what we discuss and for how long<br
/><br
/><b>LEAN COFFEE</b><br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/><ul><li>Github structure, PR:&nbsp; II</li
><li>Ideas about where to try and publish something like this [AIDAN]&nbsp; I</li
><li>Definition of a community II| 3<ul><li>NOTES Our aim is about defining/descrbing features of a succesful community. Bjoern'd like to avoid missing a project. But we're not just a list of great bioinformatics projects, as a great project or tool doesn't necessarily have a great community - he'd like to get definitions of these (great community vs great tool). Community of developers version a community of supporters? Cufflinks isn't a community project, but it is highly-cited. Want to have a list of big good ones that are good examples. Maybe we can agree what our list of 'features of great communities of this kind'.</li
><li>Keep going: I</li
><li>Stop: II|II</li></ul
></li
><li>Definition of a *bioinformatics* project (vs just a general open source project that is useful for bioinformatics) III 3<ul><li>Why only bioinformatics?</li
><li>Separation between code and teaching communities?</li></ul
></li
><li>Deciding how to decide on which features to include in an article - what do we think would be a good process? [AIDAN] I<ul><li>Getting in touch with the people who established open source community (Software/Data carpentry, FOSTER in Europe) with our feature list and get direct insight of what worked and what did not work for them.</li></ul
></li
><li>Formulation of a vision of a project [KONRAD] II| 3<ul><li>How an open source project defines a vision - he thinks&nbsp;</li></ul
></li
><li>How to find consensus/make decisions [KONRAD] I</li
><li>Breaking the bigger question into smaller questions</li
><li>Decide how we will structure paper II</li
><li>Content to put in an introduction [AIDAN]</li
><li>Approaching communities<ul><li>Bjoern: I think we should create a few questions and send them to a defined list of communities, similar to this manuscript: <a href="http://www.biologydirect.com/content/10/1/43">http://www.biologydirect.com/content/10/1/43</a> III 3&nbsp;&nbsp;</li
><li>Manuscript contacted people who maintain pipelines, and got their opinions, and built this into the manuscript - they were sent 3 questions to each of these people, asked them to write these, and then worked them into the manuscript - he thinks we need concrete questions to hand over to the communities - Dave likes the idea.Helps us not miss things. Konrad says 'need to keep the question list short' - Bastien intersted in hearing from people about failure of communities - worry (from Bjoern) that asking people to fork/pull is a bit much - for some we do it based on their emails, for others they prefer to do it by fork/pull<br/><br
/><br/><br
/><br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>Options:<br
/><br
/>- decide on definitinos of great commnity, community - give this to just a couple of people<br
/><br
/><br
/>3. After that, we'll discuss and try to decide on the following issues (might change this based on Lean Coffee)&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/>4.<br
/><br
/>A.&nbsp; Are the 'features' we've listed in need of:<br
/><ul><li>addition&nbsp;</li
><li>deletion&nbsp;</li
><li>editing&nbsp;<br/><br
/></li></ul
>Malvika thinks there's no connection of the points - it would help to be able to link them in to each other, stories<br
/><br
/>Bjoern finds it too long, and also has problems with the communities on the list -whether they are big enough.<br
/><br
/>-------------<br
/><br
/>Decide what the scope is - bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, training<br
/><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/aidanbudd/bosc2015/blob/master/listOfOSBCs.md">https://github.com/aidanbudd/bosc2015/blob/master/listOfOSBCs.md</a><ul><li>people have already listed some communities here</li></ul
></li
><li>Give one person the job of building consensus around a scope</li
><li>Vote on this&nbsp;<br/><br
/></li
><li>SCOPE: open source scientific communities but stressing/emphasis on biological communities (where that is taken to mean using computers used to work with biological data) using OSI definiton of it, to training communities<ul><li>Keeping the scope of the readers wider, however most of the examples will come from bioinformatics communities due to our backgrounds WE"ve CHOSEN THIS</li
><li>FOR NEXT TIME - BJOERN maybe, AIDAN, KONRAD after that, BASTIEN<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>What process to use to share that work between us? Collect suggestions from us all, and vote on one of them - I think we have to make this discussion today, so will use voting, consensus-building takes too long. OK with that process?<br
/><br
/>B. How to structure the content associated with each 'feature'? I'd like this to be done in a way that it's easy to focus on giving examples from different real communities - do you agree? If not, what would you most like to focus on, how would you like to structure it? Currently we've tried to do for each feature:<br
/><br
/><ul><li>short exposition of what is meant by the 'feature'</li
><li>reasons why this is important for a great community of this kind:</li
><li>challenges in both (a) establishing and (b) maintaining this feature in such a community</li
><li>tips for both (a) establishing and (b) maintaining this feature:&nbsp;<br/><br
/></li></ul
>WAIT FOR THE FEATURS BEFORE DOING THIS<br
/><br
/><br
/>What process to use to put current content into this framework?<br
/><br
/>C. Do you think it'd be useful to meet again?<br
/><br
/>5. Agree action points<br
/><br
/>- agree a time frame off line<br
