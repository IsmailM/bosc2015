# Process used to develop BOSC2015 Unconference Sessions on OS communities to an article

Description of process used to work towards an article describing. Might be useful/interesting for others who want to crowdsource in this way to have this information.

## Visioning to collect from session participants a list of features of great bioinformatics open source software communities 

### 1st Unconference session, Friday July 10th 2015

Used "visioining" for the group to discuss this issue in many parallel discussions. In final 1-on-1 chat, partners wrote down on index cards the key features they feel are shared by great open source bioinformaitcs software communities.

Aidan collected these cards at the end of the session, and put this list online in an Etherpad (removing redundancy, and doing some editing of the 'features') for use in the next day's session. The file "2015_07_10_visioningSessionCardsTranscribed.md" contains Aidan's initial transcription of all the cards. The file "2015_07_11_possibleOSTDiscussionTopics.md" contains the edited list of features taken from these transcripts.
