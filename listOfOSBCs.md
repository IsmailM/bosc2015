The idea is to have a list of communities and write a short paragraph about them. Moreover, we can contact each of them to get opinions and solve: #9 i.e. interest in getting examples included from more different communities

- [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/)
    - GalaxyP
    - IUC
- [BioJS](http://biojs.net/) ([community paper](http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e07009))
- [BioConductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/)
- [BioJava](http://biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- [BioRuby](http://www.bioruby.org/)
- [BioPython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- [BioSQL](http://biosql.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- [BioPerl](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- [EMBOSS](http://emboss.sourceforge.net/what/)
- [BioMoby](http://www.biomoby.org/)
- [GMOD](http://gmod.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- [mothur](http://www.mothur.org/)
- [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/)

Please feel free to add more.

Several of the communities listed above were added by looking at the list of main projects of the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects)

And Wikipedia also has a [list of open-source Bioinformatics software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_bioinformatics_software)
