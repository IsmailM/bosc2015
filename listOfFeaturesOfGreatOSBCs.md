# List of features of great open source bioinformatics communities

- **Open transparent effective efficient respectful communication**
    - A friendly, responsive, culture of discussion
        -  **reasons why this is important for a great community of this kind**:
            - communication and discussion is the life-blood of community; it's how the interactions that make up the community happen. If this is positive and constructive, most people are encouraged by, and enjoy the interaction, and thus are more likely to do more of it
            - if the response to questions, contributions, is quick, then people are more likely to be able to keep track of discussions, feel that they are active, have them more likely to deliver useful answers/solutions, and to reach these more quickly
        - **challenges in both (a) establishing and (b) maintaining this feature in such a community**
            - enough, enthusiastic, positive people need to be listening to people comments, acknowledging their actions, and responding to them, for people to feel that they are being listened too, and to build active discussions. If you start as a small group, this is a challenge, as it requires more contirbution/time commitment from each member than when the group is larger
            - once you have a larger group of contributors to discussions, it's important to actively support and promote the friendly, respectful, welcoming tone
        - **tips for both (a) establishing and (b) maintaining this feature**:
            - BioJS uses a "Gitter channel (https://gitter.im/biojs), which currently includes 47 members, is a public chat-room that is directly linked to our GitHub repository. Developers use the Gitter channel to announce new commits, bug fixes, patches and forks. Questions and answers about source code are posted to the room on a daily basis and, as a matter of principle, the core development team attempts to provide immediate responses on the Gitter channel." (quoted from http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e07009)

    - Welcoming, supportive, including (lots of?) positive interaction between old and new members
    - Extensive access to and communication with users
    - All people who'd enjoy being part of it know about it
    - Clear vision and mission
    - Quick responses to bug fixes/feature requests
    - Contributions acknowledged and rewarded
        - **reasons why this is important for a great community of this kind**:
            - Its one of the important factors that motivates members to keep on being an active contributor
            - Helps in self sustaining and increasing visibility within a community
        - **challenges in both (a) establishing and (b) maintaining this feature in such a community**:
            - In a smaller community where people are passionate about certain project and don't care about getting credits until they don't get it (address this by fixing the problem before it occurs)
        - **tips for both (a) establishing and (b) maintaining this feature**:
            - A profile page for each member where the contributions can be recorded
            - Motivating academics by publishing papers using models like BioJS: Professional credit. BioJS published an 'Application Note' in *Bioinformaitcs* with all contributing members as authors. BioJS has organised that application-note-type-articles are publishable in F1000 for individual BioJS modules, giving contributors an easy way of getting their contributions acknowledged within the scientific literature
            - Even a small edit/update should be mentioned: Social credits
            - A common update news with the topic "Who's doing what?"
            - Updates of contribution in the documents, release notes, monthly new letters
    - Has a mailing list to keep users up-to-date about the projects they are involved in, or provides syndication feed.
    - Well designed strategy to increase its visibility to the community (use of social media, conferences etc.)
    - Provides a short glossary to help users quickly understand basic things, for example, types of open-source licenses, version control systems (VCS), & other relevant components of open-source â€“ Optional.
    - Effective efficient decision making

- **Rich in resources (e.g. infrastructure, project leads, learning materials and help from older members for new members etc)**
    - Enough members who take on a mentoring role - helps keep active contributors motivated, guiding projects, avoiding conflicts etc.
    - Members are diverse in terms of demographics, perspectives, and experience

- **Self-sustaining/perpetuating**

- **Effective structure**
    - Effective efficient (inspiring?) leadership
    - Project provides support and encouragement for associated sub-projects/sub-communities
    - Offer different levels of contributions (e.g. Code contributions, documentation enhancements, User support)
    - Organisational structure is flexible, adapted through time to respond to changing needs

- **Excellent software and related infrastructure**
    - Usability
        - Understandability
        - Documentation
        - Buildability
        - Installability
        - Learnability
    - Sustainability and maintainability
        - Identity
        - Copyright
        - Licencing
        - Accessibility
        - Testability
        - Portability
        - Analysability
        - Changeability
        - Interoperability
        
The points originally under this category, it was pointed out by @mr-c, were a subset of the criteria described by the Software Sustainability Institute's ["Software Evaluation: Criteria-based Assessment"](http://software.ac.uk/sites/default/files/SSI-SoftwareEvaluationCriteria.pdf) written by Mike Jackson, Steve Crouch and Rob Baxter. Thus, I've simply added here the list of criteria from that document, reference it for more explanation of what's meant. (Note I've left out several of the features from the SSI document (Governance, Community, Supportability, Evolvability), as IMHO they're covered by features listed, in this document, in different categories than the "Excellent software and related infrastructure" here)
    

- **Supports(/enables?) reproducible research**
    - Values openness (this is implied, therefore should be a part of introduction rather than a feature; <Aidan>although, there are many aspects to openness, [to ideas, to new people, to publication, to code], perhaps it's worth having it as an extra 'feature' given that [I think] great communities of this kind also have these general, other kinds of openness as a feature...?</Aidan>)
    - Values reproducibility
