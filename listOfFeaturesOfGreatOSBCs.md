# List of features of great open source bioinformatics communities

## Welcoming, supportive, including (lots of?) positive interaction between old and new members

## Members are diverse in terms of demographics, perspectives, and experience

## Rich in resources (e.g. infrastructure, project leads, learning materials and help from older members for new members etc)

## Address a clear specific useful need (Issue tracking)

## Value openness (this is implied, therefore should be a part of introduction rather than a feature; <Aidan>although, there are many aspects to openness, [to ideas, to new people, to publication, to code], perhaps it's worth having it as an extra 'feature' given that [I think] great communities of this kind also have these general, other kinds of openness as a feature...?</Aidan>)

## Software is easy to install, and installable on multiple platforms

## Software is well documented, including manuals and tutorials

## Well designed strategy to increase its visibility to the community (use of social media, conferences etc.)

## Value reproducibility

## Registration/login process is easy and quick for users + allows users to connect their Github/SourceForge/BitBucket accounts or even Galaxy account if possible
