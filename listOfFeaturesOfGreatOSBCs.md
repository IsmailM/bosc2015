# List of features of great open source bioinformatics communities

- **Open transparent effective efficient respectful communication**
    - A friendly culture of discussion
    - Welcoming, supportive, including (lots of?) positive interaction between old and new members
    - Extensive access to and communication with users
    - All people who'd enjoy being part of it know about it
    - Clear vision and mission
    - Quick responses to bug fixes/feature requests
    - Contributions acknowledged and rewarded
    - Has a mailing list to keep users up-to-date about the projects they are involved in, or provides syndication feed.
    - Well designed strategy to increase its visibility to the community (use of social media, conferences etc.)
    - Provides a short glossary to help users quickly understand basic things, for example, types of open-source licenses, version control systems (VCS), & other relevant components of open-source â€“ Optional.
    - Effective efficient decision making

- **Rich in resources (e.g. infrastructure, project leads, learning materials and help from older members for new members etc)**
    - Enough members who take on a mentoring role - helps keep active contributors motivated, guiding projects, avoiding conflicts etc.
    - Members are diverse in terms of demographics, perspectives, and experience

- **Self-sustaining/perpetuating**

- **Effective structure**
    - Effective efficient (inspiring?) leadership
    - Project provides support and encouragement for associated sub-projects/sub-communities
    - Offer different levels of contributions (e.g. Code contributions, documentation enhancements, User support)
    - Organisational structure is flexible, adapted through time to respond to changing needs

- **Excellent software and related infrastructure**
    - Usability
        - Understandability
        - Documentation
        - Buildability
        - Installability
        - Learnability
    - Sustainability and maintainability
        - Identity
        - Copyright
        - Licencing
        - Accessibility
        - Testability
        - Portability
        - Analysability
        - Changeability
        - Interoperability
        
The points originally under this category, it was pointed out by @mr-c, were a subset of the criteria described by the Software Sustainability Institute's ["Software Evaluation: Criteria-based Assessment"](http://software.ac.uk/sites/default/files/SSI-SoftwareEvaluationCriteria.pdf) written by Mike Jackson, Steve Crouch and Rob Baxter. Thus, I've simply added here the list of criteria from that document, reference it for more explanation of what's meant. (Note I've left out several of the features from the SSI document (Governance, Community, Supportability, Evolvability), as IMHO they're covered by features listed, in this document, in different categories than the "Excellent software and related infrastructure" here)
    

- **Supports(/enables?) reproducible research**
    - Values openness (this is implied, therefore should be a part of introduction rather than a feature; <Aidan>although, there are many aspects to openness, [to ideas, to new people, to publication, to code], perhaps it's worth having it as an extra 'feature' given that [I think] great communities of this kind also have these general, other kinds of openness as a feature...?</Aidan>)
    - Values reproducibility
    
If/when have time, the excellent software list could probably best be integrated with the Software Sustainability Institute's [criteria based software evaluation guide](http://www.software.ac.uk/software-evaluation-guide)
