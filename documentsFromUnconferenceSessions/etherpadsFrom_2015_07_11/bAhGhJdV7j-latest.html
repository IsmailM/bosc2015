<body><b>Effective access to and communication with users</b><br
/>Brad, Carole, Aurelie, Sara, Herve<br
/><br
/>What are examples of software that failed?<br
/><br
/>Sara volunteers an example from her own experience. GenomeSpace needs additional recipes from users -- what are they doing and can they contribute back to it? Do not have a forum or mailing list so people can contribute back.<br
/><br
/>Suggestion from Carole -- go out and actually work with users in real time. Users are in the lab. Focus on graduate students and other folks with time/interest.<br
/><br
/>Aurelie -- need to build a relationship with users so it's easier to impose on their time to get feedback. Need to find a very easy way to get information from them since they're not used to communicating in this way. Different people have different ways of communicating and might need multiple ways: forum, mailing lists, wiki, in person.<br
/><br
/>Sara -- need to find people that are have lots of interest. Mailing list is not open as a place for discussion. More setup for bug reports and discussion amongst developers. You need a specific type of culture that makes it easy to discuss these things, or pointers to go the right place for asking.<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;Specific webinars that are short and focused to get people involved -- can't have a bigger talk with too many things at the same time.<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;Problem is when people fail and are nervous and might not submit a bug report. Fear of looking like they don't know what they're doing. Is there a way to create a culture that it's easier for people to do this?<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;Herve -- make it easier/lightweight to submit report and fixes.<br
/>&nbsp;Carole -- better FAQs<br
/>&nbsp;Sara -- biologists aren't using GitHub<br
/>&nbsp;Herve -- move to QA sites like BioStars<br
/><br
/>Need to be friendly and listen to users, and be responsive-- can get tough when you get busy.<br
