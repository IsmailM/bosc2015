<body>Good example: plotly.io, reacts quickly to user requests and bug reports<br
/><br
/>Quick turnaround time on bug reports and fixes is important.<br
/><br
/>Of all your users, maybe 5 % interact with you, retain those to turn them into contributors, make the community sustainable.<br
/><br
/>Communication is key here, people spent time communicating with you, so you should also spend time responding to them.<br
/><br
/>Make it obvious how to contact you and contribute patches or bug reports. Feedback forms are great, as are issue trackers.<br
/><br
/>The community's response time to issues and patches is a good measure of the project's viability.<br
/><br
/>Make it easy and obvious for people contributing to submit the right kind of patches/bug reports. This lowers the effort of contributors to handle patches/issues.<br
